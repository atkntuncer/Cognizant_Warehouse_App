# Cognizant_Warehouse_App

- Frontend project is inside of the \Cognizant_Warehouse_App\Angular\warehouse_app_ui directory. 
- Kestrel is used for debugging. So adress of the backend api is 'http://localhost:5000/api'. 
However you can change it in Cognizant_Warehouse_App\Angular\warehouse_app_ui\src\app\shared\warehouse.service.ts if you want to.
-Sqlite database is in Cognizant_Warehouse_App\Warehouses.db. You can change its adress in Cognizant_Warehouse_App\Repository\BaseRepository.cs.
(I made it relative to solution path, so I didn't add to the appsettings.json)
